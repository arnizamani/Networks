This program is a prototype implementation of an autonomous learning agent
based on transparent neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Program authors:
Abdul Rahim Nizamani
Claes Strannegård

The model for this prototype implementation is described in the following
scientific paper:

Claes Strannegård and Abdul Rahim Nizamani: Integrating symbolic and sub-
symbolic reasoning, submitted to ninth conference on Artificial General
Intelligence, New York City, 2016.

This is only a prototype program and does not have all the features and
mechanisms of the model as described in the paper.
